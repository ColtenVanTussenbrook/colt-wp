Site built using WordPress for the backend as a headless CMS, and then 100% React on the frontend. The theme is basic, but with a developer who knows React and WordPress, it can be extended to do just about anything you want. 

All data is fetched using WPgraphql. There should be no WordPress used on the frontend -- yay no jQuery!

Backend can be completely configured using WordPress admin. Front end rendering is done with React.
