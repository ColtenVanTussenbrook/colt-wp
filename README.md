## Portfolio Site

Basic portfolio site built using a WordPress backend (PHP) and React on the frontend. 

I wanted an easy way to write blog posts, but I wanted to render everything with React. So this is 100% headless.

Feel free to use this theme. It will require React knowledge in order to be able to do much, however.
